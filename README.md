# Pomodoro Timer

This project is a React-based implementation of a Pomodoro Timer. The timer uses the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

## Features

- **Three Modes**: The timer supports three modes - 'Work', 'Short Break', and 'Long Break'.
  
- **State Persistence**: The timer state is saved in the local storage, allowing you to pick up where you left off even after closing the browser.

- **Dynamic UI**: The timer uses SVG to display a graphical representation of time left, which changes color based on the current mode.

- **User Control**: You can start, pause, or reset the timer as needed.

This is a great tool for anyone looking to improve their productivity and manage their time more effectively.
